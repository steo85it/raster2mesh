# Quickly convert a raster map to a 3D mesh #

## How to use ##
For a quick template application, run `main.py`.
You will get a map of the lunar South Pole region.
Define a rectangle by clicking on the 4 vertices with your mouse: a 3d mesh of the region
with the desired resolution is generated.
The second part of the code shows how to clip a region of the mesh by selecting it from a
raster map of it (the 2 functions can be used together or separately, provided that the raster
does cover the same region as the mesh).

## Installation ##

### Set up a virtual environment and clone the repository ###

Make a new directory and clone this repository to it. Then, inside the
directory that you've just created, run `python -m venv .`. This will
create a "virtual environment", which is a useful tool that Python
provides for managing dependencies for projects. The new directory
"contains" the virtual environment.

### Activate the virtual environment ###

To activate the virtual environment, run `source bin/activate` from
the directory containing it. Make sure to do this before doing
anything else below.

### Getting the dependencies ###

Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r
requirements.txt`.

### Installing this package ###

Finally, run:
``` shell
pip install .
```
To install the package in editable mode, so that changes in this
directory propagate immediately, run:
``` shell
pip install -e .
```
